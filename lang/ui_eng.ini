# How to translate into a different language
#  - Copy this file in the same directory, naming it ui_xxx
#    (where xxx is the identifier of the desired language,
#    i.e. ui_fra for a French translation
#
#  - DON'T translate the key names!
#
#  - DON'T translate the text between braces, i.e. {n_tiles},
#    that part must remain untouched as it will be replaced
#    automatically by the program with proper text
#
